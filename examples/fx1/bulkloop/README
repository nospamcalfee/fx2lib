This demo does a bulk transfer to/from a keyspan USA-19Qi usb/serial adapter
It has been tested on Linux, ubuntu karmic 9.10
It does not use libusb, just the raw sysfs and dev/usb/ files supported

first in the fx1/bulkloop example directory type:
make
Then in the utils directory build the test program:
cc -Wall -g -o xferusb xferusb.c

cd back into the fx1/bulkloop example directory, and

If you have done a fresh plug-in of the cypress usb device:
./cypress_load
If you have previously loaded the ezusb software, reload with:
./my_load

To run a sample test:
./run_test


look at run_test to get an idea of how to run xfertest.
