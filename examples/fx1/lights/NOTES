To actually load and run the program - install the linux fxload.

You have to unbind the keyspan driver:
first find the devices unique number:
tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/keyspan/
Use its bus,port number to unbind:
sudo chmod a+w /sys/bus/usb/drivers/keyspan/unbind
sudo echo -n "5-1:1.0" >/sys/bus/usb/drivers/keyspan/unbind

You have to mount the usbfs on Ubuntu
sudo mount -t usbfs u /proc/bus/usb/

Once you find the usb device, this loads the program.
The first number is the bus number, the second is the USB device address
it may change if a reenumeration occurs.
 
sudo fxload -D /proc/bus/usb/005/002 -I lights.ihx
